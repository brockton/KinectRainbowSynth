On-screen keyboard for Kinect. Built using MS Kinect SDK in C# and WPF. 
Audio for piano is provided using NAudio (http://naudio.codeplex.com/) with 
samples from http://audio.ibeat.org/?ccm=/media/files/DaDeMo/469. 
Organ uses a software synthesizer using the Sanford C# Synth Toolkit from 
http://www.codeproject.com/KB/audio-video/synthtoolkitparti.aspx . 
This is an initial version to bring test some ideas. 
Includes voice recognition to change between organ and piano. 
Unlike other synths I've seen it does not require any additional software 
or hardware as it is self-contained.
Codebase is now available at https://github.com/grazulis/KinectRainbowSynth
